Hello People!

My name is Victor, I find programming to be interesting, but I have much to learn. I wish I could just jam this all in my brain in one sitting, but I don't believe that is possible so I am willing to take it one step at a time. I have tried programming before and I can't seem to stick to it partly because I am not doing what I should. I hope to change these bad habits and make good habits out of them.
